# Book List Bot
Discord bot that keeps track of books a user wants to read/have read. Uses the Google Books API (because Goodreads retired their API =_=).

## Commands 
*Note: Not all commands are currently functional, new ones may be added soon.*
Need to modify user input format because it's too rigid. 

```!add-book [Book Name] by [Author]``` - Adds a new book to the list. 

```!in-progress [Book Name] by [Author]``` - Marks a book as 'in progress' in the list 

```!completed [Book Name] by [Author]``` - Marks a book as completed in the list

```!delete-book [Book Name] by [Author]``` - Deletes the book from the list

```!display-list``` - Shows user the book list

```!delete-list``` - Removes all books from the book list

```!about```

```!commands```

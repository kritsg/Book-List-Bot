# Book List Bot
Discord bot that keeps track of books a user wants to read/have read. Uses the Google Books API.

## Commands 
*Note: Not all commands are currently functional, new ones may be added soon.*

Semi-functional

```!add [book name|Google Books link]``` - Searches for the user-requested book and asks if the user wants to add the book to the list (if it isn't added already) [Note: this doesn't actually add to a list yet]. 

```!search [book name|Google Books link]``` - Searches for the book and displays the first result from Google Books.

Not functional (but will be implemented):

```!list``` - Shows user the book list

```!clear``` - Removes all books from the book list

```!commands``` - Returns all of the commands a user can use
